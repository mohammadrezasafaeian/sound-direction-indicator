## TL;DR

A $10 device that shows deaf users **where** sound is coming from. Four microphones detect direction, a ring of LEDs points toward it. Plug into any USB power bank — no app, no pairing, no setup.

**The interesting engineering problem:** Traditional sound localization requires 100 kHz+ sampling and complex DSP. I found a way to do it with a **$1 microcontroller, 10 Hz sampling, and under 30 bytes of RAM** — by solving the problem in the analog domain instead of the digital one.

---

## The Problem

Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals miss critical environmental sounds — doorbells, alarms, someone calling from another room. Existing solutions are expensive, require smartphone apps, or involve complex setup.

## The Solution

    LEDS --> USER["👁️ User sees<br>direction + intensity"]

    style DEVICE fill:#e7f5ff,stroke:#339af0
```

Plug into any USB power bank → Device detects sound → LED ring shows direction and intensity.

**No app. No pairing. No configuration.**

## Skills Demonstrated

> **For recruiters:** This project demonstrates end-to-end hardware product design — from initial trade-off analysis through analog circuit design, PCB layout, and firmware architecture — with a focus on solving the right problem at the right abstraction level.

| Domain | What I Did | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **System Architecture** | Evaluated two fundamentally different approaches (TDOA vs. envelope detection); chose amplitude comparison to eliminate DSP entirely | Shows I optimize at the architecture level, not just the implementation level |
| **Analog Circuit Design** | Designed a 4-channel signal chain: electret preamps (×23), Schottky envelope detectors, differential amplifiers (×33) — all from a single 5V USB supply | Demonstrates practical analog design with real-world constraints |
| **Noise Engineering** | Split ground planes, ferrite-isolated analog rail, differential topology for common-mode rejection, 100 nF decoupling at every mic and LED | Shows I think about what can go wrong, not just what should go right |
| **PCB Layout** | 2-layer 80 mm circular board with zero-via mic traces, +5V inductive ring, and strategic ground partitioning | Shows understanding of how layout affects analog signal integrity |
| **Firmware Design** | ATtiny24A: 3-ch ADC → `atan2(Y,X)` → WS2812B; under 1 KB flash, under 30 bytes RAM | Shows I match the solution to the problem — no over-engineering |
| **Cost Engineering** | Full BOM sourced and priced; every component evaluated for availability, cost, and hand-solderability | Shows product thinking, not just prototype thinking |
| **Design for Evolution** | Architecture validated for wearable glasses form factor — same analog chain transfers directly | Shows I design systems with a future, not just for today |

### The Decision That Defined the Project

The most impactful engineering decision was not a component choice or a circuit trick — it was **reframing the problem**:

> *"Don't measure when the sound arrives. Measure how loud it is on each side."*

This single insight eliminated the need for high-speed ADC, FFT, cross-correlation, trace-length matching, large RAM buffers, and a powerful MCU. It reduced a $30+ DSP problem to a $10 analog one.

```

**Amplitude comparison instead of time-of-arrival.** One architectural decision, seven downstream benefits:

| What It Eliminates | What It Enables |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| 100 kHz+ sampling requirement | ~10 Hz ADC reads are sufficient |
| FFT / cross-correlation DSP | Simple `atan2(Y, X)` in firmware |
| Critical PCB trace-length matching | Relaxed layout — no matched pairs |
| Large MCU (ATmega328P+) | Minimal MCU (ATtiny24A, 2 KB flash) |
| Large RAM buffers for audio | Under 30 bytes total RAM |
| High-speed ADC, DMA, capture timers | Basic ADC + GPIO only |
| Complex firmware (thousands of lines) | Under 1 KB, simple loop |

| Stage | Function | Key Detail |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Preamp** | Amplify mic signals ×23 | Non-inverting, MCP6004 rail-to-rail |
| **Envelope** | Extract amplitude (1.6 Hz BW) | BAT54 Schottky + 10 kΩ / 10 µF RC |
| **Differential** | X = East−West, Y = North−South | ×33 gain, cancels common-mode noise |
| **MCU** | Compute angle, drive LEDs | `atan2(Y, X)` → 12-sector mapping |

---

## How It Works

### Direction Extraction

The system computes sound direction from two differential signals:

```
X = 33 × (Envelope_East − Envelope_West)
Y = 33 × (Envelope_North − Envelope_South)
angle = atan2(Y, X)
sector = (angle + 15°) / 30°      → maps to 1 of 12 LEDs
```

### Noise Immunity

The 100 ms envelope filter provides massive rejection of high-frequency interference:

| Noise Source | Rejection |
|--------------|-----------|
| WS2812B switching (800 kHz) | > 100 dB |
| RF pickup (MHz range) | > 100 dB |
| Audio-frequency EMI (1 kHz) | ~56 dB |
| Mains hum (50/60 Hz) | ~30 dB |

**Differential topology** cancels common-mode power supply noise — even if USB cable noise is rectified by the envelope detectors, it appears equally on all four channels and subtracts out:

```
(V_North + V_Noise) − (V_South + V_Noise) = V_North − V_South
```

### Adjustable Response Time

A single capacitor swap tunes the speed vs. stability trade-off — no circuit redesign:

| Capacitor | Time Constant | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| 10 µF (default) | 100 ms | Balanced response and stability |
| 4.7 µF | 47 ms | Faster response |
| 1 µF | 10 ms | Very fast, less stable |

</p>

| Design Choice | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Zero-via mic traces** | High-impedance mic signals routed on top layer only — no vias — to minimize parasitic inductance |
| **Split ground planes** | AGND and GND joined via 0 Ω resistor at USB entry; prevents digital switching currents from flowing through analog ground |
| **+5V ring on bottom layer** | Long trace acts as inductive choke, filtering 800 kHz WS2812B switching noise |
| **Digital GND ring on top** | Low-impedance return path keeps LED currents on the perimeter, away from the analog center |
| **100 nF at every mic and LED** | Local decoupling compensates for long traces inherent to the circular layout |

**Why external power bank instead of built-in battery:**

| Built-in Battery | External Power Bank |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Adds weight to the device | Device stays lightweight |
| Requires boost converter (adds switching noise) | Clean 5V directly — no converter noise in analog chain |
| Battery ages and degrades | Power bank easily replaced |
| Needs charging circuit, protection, fuel gauge | Simple USB-C input — nothing to design |
| Fixed capacity | User chooses capacity for their use case |

~270 mA draw also works via **phone OTG** (within typical 500 mA limit) for quick demos.

## Firmware Architecture

### Algorithm

```
loop (every 50 ms):
    1. Read ADC: X, Y, Intensity
    2. If intensity < threshold → clear LEDs, continue
    3. Center: X -= 512, Y -= 512
    4. angle = atan2(Y, X)
    5. sector = (angle + 15°) / 30°      → 0..11
    6. color = (intensity > loud) ? RED : BLUE
    7. Output sector + color → WS2812B ring
```

### Resource Budget

| Resource | Available | Used |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Flash | 2 KB | ~1 KB |
| RAM | 128 bytes | < 30 bytes |
| ADC channels | 8 | 3 (X, Y, Intensity) |
| GPIO | 12 | 4 (1 LED data + 3 ADC) |

### What the Envelope Architecture Eliminated

No high-speed ADC. No DMA. No capture timers. No SPI/I2C. No UART. No audio buffers. No DSP library. The ATtiny24A's basic ADC and a single GPIO pin are all the firmware needs.

The same analog signal chain transfers directly to a wearable form factor — **no circuit redesign required:**

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Wider mic spacing** | 15–20 cm (head width) vs. 8 cm (PCB) — larger amplitude differences, better accuracy |
| **Lightweight glasses** | Only LEDs + mics on head; processing + power in pocket |
| **Natural orientation** | Direction shown relative to where the user is looking |
| **Discrete appearance** | Looks like normal glasses with subtle LED accents |

**Roadmap:** Desktop prototype → Split wearable prototype → Custom glasses frame → Miniaturized wireless product

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Status | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Fixed sensitivity (no gain adjustment) | Future revision | Add gain potentiometer |
| Small mic spacing on PCB (8 cm) | Addressed in glasses version | Acoustic baffle in housing for desktop version |
| Internal RC oscillator drift | Monitor | Add external crystal if timing issues observed |
| Not yet fabricated | PCB manufacturing in progress | Will update with test results |
